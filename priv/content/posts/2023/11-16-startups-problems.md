The hardest thing about starting a startup is finding an idea that you are sure will work in the market. But coming up an idea in this market where every good idea seems to be taken is really hard.

# Build a Business, Not a Startup
Rather than trying to build out a startup, start with a business. A business is about building something that can help you solve a problem. In that case the first step is finding a problem. The way you can gather problems is across three ways, ranked from the most effective to the least effective at finding problems that work.

## Have the problem yourself
The best way to make sure there is a problem is to make sure that you have the problem yourself. This has the added advantage of establishing emperical evidence from the start itself. Stripe and AirBnB are the best examples of founders having these problems. 

## Talk to people who you want to help
The second way is start with a demographic of people who you want to help. This means even when things get hard, you won't leave the idea half baked.

## Come up with the Problem by researching the space
Even though this isn't as effective as teh other two ideas, you can learn about the space and 

## Come up with a solution first
This has the least chance of working and requires the highest level of commitment in the next step.


# Gather Emperical Evidence about the Problem
This is the important step. You have to gather emperical evidence to convince yourself that there is indeed a problem in the problem that you have decided to solve. This would require you to talk to the people who you think might have the problem. But rather than working on the problem first, talk to people who you might have that problem. You are looking for emotionally charged solution, it's either love or hate, not indifference. You have to make sure that the problem is a damn big problem for the people that you want the problem to be.

But don't ask them if they have the problem, that would only make them say yes, remember people always chooses the easiest way out. Make them work for it, and if they have a big enough problem they will be screaming from the rooftops for a solution, you just have to listen. Read the Mom Test for a great reference.

# Does the Problem deserve to be solved
Even though all the problems require a solution, doesn't mean it deserves to be solved. Most people hate thier healthcare bills and espeically on the American Healthcare system, but the problems requires so much effort from multiple parties with conflicting interest and above all incentives that you can't solve with any throughput. You have to vet the problems to your mold, make sure you are the person to solve the issue.

That is how you come up with ideas that have the chance of turning into a business that has the potential to turn into something that ads value to the world. Remember to find problems, gather emperical evidence and make sure the problem deserves to be solved by you.
