TailwindCSS is a [utility first]() CSS framework primarily designed for the modern web. Rather than giving a bunch of predefined classes such as `button button-primary`, it gives a collection of well thought out atomic classes such as `px-2 text-gray-200` that can be composed together to form our own custom styles. 

I have been using TailwindCSS since 2020 and in this post I'll explain why I love it so much and why I use it for all my projects by default.

### Consistently Simple Styling Abstraction
Tailwind is a light abstraction over CSS. CSS akin to Javascript grew up with the World Wide Web and so it has all the quirks you expect from the web. There are specificity issues, vendor specific flags, styling quirks that you will only understand once you have spend your time mastering it. What Tailwind does it, it takes CSS and creates an abstraction on top by what you want done, rather than how to do it.

It is also consistent across projects. I have no problem working on projects that I have worked on in the beginning with Tailwind as the classes and their functionality have remained the same. After a while the mental vocabulary of classes is enough to build out entire projects without ever consulting any documentation.

### Cross-platform
I work across the Web and Mobile with React Native. Since Tailwind is an abstraction there are libraries that let you use it to style your mobile apps as well such as [twrc](). This reduces context switching when working on the web and the mobile platform side by side.

### Beautiful by default
Tailwind was developed with a lot of help from [Steve Shrogner](), who is an awesome designer, and before that they had worked on a book called [Refactoring UI](). What they have done is distill the lessons of the book in a usable framework. The end result is a flexible framework with beautiful building blocks which when combined produces something beautiful by default.

### Ecosystem
Tailwind has a host of tools, plugins and documentations surrounding it. The existing functionality of the

In the end  you are free to use any frameworks that you please, but you have to understand that your technological choices comes with tradeoffs, both at the developer and user experience level.
