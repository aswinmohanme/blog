God is a tricky topic to talk about. The belief about the existence, absense and the various forms of it is so deeply ingrained that any civil discourse on god is going to turn ugly real fast. But just because there is a chance of shit going wrong doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about it.

This post outlines what I believe about God, about Life and our place in the Universe. Remember this is my perspective on god, my faith and my reasons for belief. Just because I believe in a version of god that has an amount of contradiction.

## Why does God exist
The existence of god has never been proven, but so has the absense of god. That is why we have faith in god, where faith is the belief in the absense of proof. For the claim that God exists to hold any merit and in the absense of proof, there should be a reason for the existence.

I believe in a God because of consiousness. The amount of chance occurings to happen for human consiousness to exist is too immense to diregard the chance of intelligent design. There is only species in the world wide world and possibly universe to the extent of our knowledge that has the capability to write about god, and I don't think that came up by chance. Our closest kin in intelligence is still working with stone tools.


## What is God
I believe God is the aggregate of consiousness across the universe. There is an entity that exists outside the continuum of space and time. There is no begginnng and end, it's just there, with celestial capabilities. This is who God really is. After a few non time frame of it's existence the Universaln consiousness started to grip with existencial dread. A creeping feeling of lonliness and the lack of ability to feel anything else than a perpetual sense of lonliness prompted the consiousness to create the known universe.

Being all alone doesn't give much space for developing and experiencing emotions. So what God was split himself into different souls.
