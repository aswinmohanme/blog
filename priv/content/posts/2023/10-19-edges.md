In an episode of the podcast, Patrick Collison of Stripe, goes on how he thinks Stripe's attention to detail and the pursuit of beauty is what might have made significant contribution to the adoption and success of stripe. Even though the notion that aesthetics might not be a big contender on the list of things for a payment processor to do, I think what Patrick might have said has some value to it.

Consider the example of building out a payment processor for the internet. Let's start with the problem space. At the center we have the handling the money itself, then a little outside the processes for reconcilation and the systems for correctly setting up the money as well, then even more on the outside we have the api's, then support. Outside that we have documentation and finally at the end great design service. Any well meaning entrepenure might stop at the well meaning support system as that solves 90% of the problem space adn solving the 10% rest would take another 90% of effort for the seemingly diminishing returns. But Stripe chose to focus on the edges with as much enuthisiasm as the center of the problem space itself and that played significant role in the adoption of the system. There were payment processors before Stripe, but compared to Stripe, they were ugly, outdated and was from the yesteryear. Stripe's core values of aesthetics played a significant role in differntiating it from it's nearest competitors, because they chose to stop at customer service ilke all thier competitors.

This principle can be extended to a lot of other domains as well. Take learning for example, everyone can learn the subject, match with the syllabus and get a decent grade. But to be the top, you have to work out the question papers from previous years, learn from extra notes, give a lot of thought into the class to figure out what the professor wants you to learn as well. That is the outsized returns, which for you have to work at the edges.

When building or working on anything, if outsized results are your goal, then figure out what the entire problem space is, what lies at the edges, which you can use to your competitive advantage and use that get forward in life.
