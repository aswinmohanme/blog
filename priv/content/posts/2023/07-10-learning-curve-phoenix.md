Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView is picking up steam. With it's recent additions of Machine learning capabilities and a cohesive ecosystem, it's gaining ground fast. But unlike the hype cycles of other languages, we do not see an influx of beginners into the language. It's mostly mid to senior level developers who are making the switch. 

It's because of the learning curve associated with the language, perspective shift required for functional programming and the no magic approach taken by Phoenix. All these issues play together to form such a connection. The same things that makes Phoenix lovable for experienced developers is what makes it difficult for junior developers to get started. This post is more of an observation on why that is.
