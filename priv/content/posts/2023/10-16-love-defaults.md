Back in my I have a lot of time on my hands days at College, I used to spent an inordinate amount of time configuring my software tools. Running custom tiling window managers, with the latest terminal emulators combined with an a fully specced out editor. I used to scorn over forums, blog posts and everything else learning about how to create the perfect config all for that exclusive productivity boost that I was after. It grew from tools, to aesthetics, spending hours finding the latest themes from Gnome Look and still spending more hours on finding matching icon and [font rendering](/better-fonts-on-linux).

I did all this believing that I was improving my productivity in the process. As a craftman I should be proud of the tools I use and should shape it exactly to my liking as well. Turns out configuring the tools turned into an bosession on it's own, robbing me of the productivity that I so chose to pursue.

Each new added layer of configuration needed to be built and worked with the existing set of configuration and plugins. Everything started to feel like a huge game of Jenga where the pieces always fell down, even when you have done nothing. Sometimes the comibnation of plugisn and tools that created these issues are so unique that you would be hte first one with those issues, which meant a lot of time on forums and on bug trackers reporting and fixing those issues.

That's when I chose to give it all up for a life of defaults. Send my final goodbyes to Linux, bought a macbook and told myself that I am not going to be spending anymore time configuring everything to what I love and would only spend the minimal amount of time on config.

So now my terminal runs the default theme and the default font. I run Doom Emacs with a minimal set of config that is only 51 lines of config code with the majority being simple tweaks for Elixir. I also made the choice to learn the default keybindings of any software that I come across rather than bending it to my will, because muscle memory is really easy to train. Run Fish shell with two plugins and everything else is managed.

So I have settled for a closed system which is as default as it comes. What have I gained by settling for such a thing. Everything is way more stable now, nothing breaks on any updates, and finally I can do what all these toosl were supposed to do from the start. Let me work on the things that really matter and stay out of the way, because at the end of the day, no one is going to hire someone who sharpens thier axe all day without cutting down the tree.
