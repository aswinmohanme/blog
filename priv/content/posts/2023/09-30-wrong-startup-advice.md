There is no shortage of startup advice in the world. With the exception of some questionable sources, most of the advice is written by former founders, investors and startup employees who want to do a nice thing for the people who are coming up and shield them from some of the mistakes they made. Even though the advice is sound, extracted from ideas that worked, and released by people with experience, it has a fairly high chance of working. But due to the very nature of startups, the market and the wold has a whole, the advice will be mostly wrong.

## Timing matters.

Even though the advice might be correct, the time when the advice worked is not the time right now. The market, the competition, the technology, the investing ecosystem has all changed substantially than the time the advice was first implemented. It's not the time when the advice was published, but when the time it was first used and that might be 10-20 years ago.

Consider the OG startup advice of building something around a problem that you have noticed in your own life. It's hard to find information on the internet gave rise to Google, hard to connect with friends Facebook, hard to share files between computers Dropbox. The doctrine has given rise to most of the biggest names in tech right now. Now consider the time when the advice started to become popular, in the end of 2000s after the initial wave of companies and consider the time when the advice was implemented and worked. It worked specatucalarly back then. If you had a personal problem and you were a good enough technologist you could build a product that however crappy would have found users who were equally frusturated with it, becuase your competiton was also upstarts like you. Fast forward to the time this advice was published. A person who had a problem of connecting with her friends would have to compete with a billion dollar beheamouth called facebook.

The second wave of startups enabled by mobile phones and better GPS tracking,

By the time you are reading the advice on how to start a startup, it's already too late and the time has passed.

## Startup advice is written with hindsight.

Startup advice is mostly written after the company has become more succesful and the founders have moved on. It's always the case.

## Read the advice, then figure out your own way.
I recommend reading the better sources you can get your hands on.

## Good Startup Advice

Does this mean everything ever written about Startups is wrong and you as an entrepeneur will have to figure out to figure out from scratch. There are some pieces of advice that distill the essence of these advice into timeless pieces of wisdom. Your job is to find out if a broader piece of advice would help you build a startup in 20 years, then it's a piece of advice that has the better reason to follow up.
