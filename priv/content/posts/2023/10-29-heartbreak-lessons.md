Last year I broke up with my first long-term girlfriend. Even though the breakup was my own doing, it threw me into a year of heartbreak, self-reflection, general depression and close to sadness for the better part of an year. I spent the better part of everyday for around 6 months and then another two of the last months searching frantically for answers and on reasons to cope.

I have debated with myself whether I should post this or not. It all came to the question that if a resource like this existed when I was going through heartbreak, it would have helped me and I said to myself it would. So here it is.

This post touches everything from getting dates, to choosing your partner, to maintaining healthy relationships, to how to handle breakups and how to let go, reconcile and move on. This post is written as advice a 24 year old guy, although it can be adapted to your circumstance. Also this is my perspective and the things and the advice that resonated with me. This is no way the best way forward and I hope you can see it too. This post is centered around getting into and maintaining long term healthy monogamous relationships.

# We need other Humans
Fulfilling relationships are not the result of a happy life, but the cause of it. Human beings are not designed to survive in isolation.

You need people to support you and motivate you.

# Understanding Yourself

The first step is to understand yourself. You have to be a good partner to attract a good partner for you and sustain it for the long term.

## Attachment Theory

### Secure
### Avoidant
### Anxious

Although these are only tendencies, the knowledge about them is not to treat your partner like shit and claim it on being an Avoidant partner. It is for you to be aware of your own tendencies so you can be sure that the issues step from yourself and not the relationship.

## Maximiser
## Hesitator
## Romanitisier

# Understand Relationship
A relatioship is something that is independent from you and your partner. You have to nurture it as a separate entity. This means that you have to put in major effort to maintina it.

## Build a relationship, not find one

# Choosing a Human Being

At the end of the day you are choosing another human being and at the core human beings are flawed.

- 80%, 20% rules
- List of three musthaves
- Attraction and sexual chemistry and not overcorrecting for it

## Don't put off dating
There is no price at the end of your career. Choose someone who you can grow with. Wouldn't it be awesome if your wife has been with you through thick and thin, rather than a supermodel who you got at the end of the line, who you can't trust to leave you when you might lose all these things.

## Asking for a date
## Acting on the date

# Maintaining a Healthy Relationship

- Don't consider everything redflags when they might just be quirks

## Maintaining great long term compatiblity
## Marriage and Kids

# Breaking Up

## Figure out if breakup is the right 
## Handling a breakup properly
## Reconcilation

# Love yourself and Trust the Universe
