Last year I broke up with my first long-term girlfriend. Even though the breakup was my own doing, it threw me into heartbreak, frantically searching for answers for one and half years. I spent an inordinate amount of time watching Youtube videos, reading books, blog and reddit posts to better understand relationships, what works in the ones that last and how to cope with heartbreak. This blog post is the culmination of all the lessons that I learnt on how to get, maintain and be happy in long-term relationships.

I have debated with myself whether I should post this or not since the information and lessons are personal enough to never see the light outside my notes. But I am deciding to publish this, because if I had come across a resource like this earlier in my journey it would have saved me a lot of pain and stress.

This post touches everything from getting dates, to choosing your partner, to maintaining healthy relationships, to how to handle breakups and how to let go, reconcile and move on. This post is written as advice my 23 year self from my current 24 year self, the tone is brotherly, personal, honest and rash. But feel free to adapt it to your circumstances. Also this is my perspective and the things and the advice that resonated with me. This is no way the best way forward and I hope you can see it too. This post is centered around getting into and maintaining long term healthy monogamous relationships. Also I am not liable nor responsible for any pain, loss or gain that you get from following this post, relationships are deeply personal undertakings, and you are the judge of what is best for you. This is a long post that covers a lot of information so reading it is going to take a lot of effort, just like amaintaining a long and healrhty relaitonship which would be a source of happiness for the rest of your life.

## We need other Humans

I earned my first internet dollar when I was 18 years old and as a college first-year. The feeling was extraordinary and the oppurtunities it opened for me were immense. So I decided that work was going to be the most important factor and goal of my life. Work suddenly became the most important factor of my life and I was fulfilled by it as well. Combined with the effortless social life afforded in the College and the glimmers of first love, I wrongly attributed my happiness and fulfillment to work and saw the rest as extra luxuries. Only after losing the social life and the relationship and getting achieving a dream career that I came to the conclusion that career was not the source of my fullfilment but it was the supporting factor here. What my work did was let me have the freedom to spend time with my friends and family, go on trips and do the things that I wanted to do. It was never the end goal.

Fulfilling relationships are not the result of a happy life, but the cause of it. Human beings are not designed to survive in isolation. We need company, we need people to share our life with, we need friends to laugh with, family to love and a partner to share the ups and downs of life with. Even in all of the most studies that studies the causes of happiness and fulfillment in life, quality human relationships rank at the highest of the chart.

You need people to support you and motivate you, or share the happiness of success with and soften the blow of failures with. Design a life, supported with your career in such a way that you have the means, ability and time to do the things you want to do with the people you love spending time with. It's okay to sacrifice, but use that sparingly only. Remember the purpose of money is so you can spend it doing the thing you love.

## Understanding Yourself

Since we have established that quality relationships contribute to a long and happy life, we need to optimise the only factor that is common across all your relationships, you. The first step is to understanding yourself, who you are, what side of you comes out in your relationship, and how you can optimise yourself for a better you in your relationships.

## Dating tendencies

- Maximiser
  You want the best partner out there. Not the partner that is perfect for you. You have a list of qualities that your partner have to fulfill.

- Hesitator
  Puts off dating for a long time until they have hit milestones in their lives.

- Romanitisier
  Has a bollywood romantic life that they want to.

Keep in mind that these are in the end of the day, just tendencies and not core behavioural traits that cannot be changed. Humans are the only species that have the ability for self-reflection and change. Use that ability.

If you want to learn more about these, read uris book.

## Attachment Theory

Who we are as adults are by default shaped by our experinences upto that point and no experience has a lasting impact on your life as the expereinces that you got when you were a child and at our most vulnerable. And since there is no globally accepted manual on parenting, and we are born to people who are doing this for the first time as well. This affects us in our most vital formative years and causes issues that surface back in the intimate forms of relationships. By no means is this a dig at our parents. Unless you have gone through actual abuse, neglect with your parents, it's always to be grateful for the sacrifices and the best effort that they did in raising you. My parents had me when they were my age, I can't fathom raising a kid at this age, but they tried their best and I am grateful for that.

How our primary caretakers interacted with us in our formative years determine our atttachment style. This attachment style can cause us to act in certain ways that even me might brand as irrational, but causes us to act like that.

### Secure

If you had most of your needs met in your childhood and had a great embodiment of stability in your childhood, you will grow up to be securely attached. A securely attached person is well secure in their relationships. They consider realationships as normal extensions of themselves, they give the neccessary space and time for their partners as well. 50% of the population is securely attached, and if they come into a relationships, they tend to stay in relationship that last.

### Avoidant

If you didn't have your needs met in your childhood, you start to do the things yourself and chose to depend less and less on your partner. This might sound great on paper, but what it does is that makes your firecely indepent and you start to make decisions and weigh it based on your decision. Avoidants tend to value independance over intimacy, and even though they care about it and want it deeply, they push people away when they get close. They also find it hard to commit, they see commiment as a threat to their indeipenedence. They end up being cold and distant, while in the relationship, and causes the other person to get anxiety. The avoidants feel guilt as well, they don't feel like htey love their partner due to the lack of their feelings in the relationships.

### Anxious

People who were abandondened in their formative years develop an anxious attachment style. They always want connection and intimacy and they react strongly if they feel it's getting smaller.

### Anxious and Avoidant Relationship

The typical toxic relationship came across when people who are anxious and avoidant come together in a realtionship. It's one of the most turmulous relationships out there. They start the realtinships when the initial chemicals have the ability to sustain it. After a while the avoidant feel like their indiependence is being threatened and they seem to pull back. This triggers out the anxiety of the avoidantly attached partner and this causes them to try even harder pushing the avoidant partner even furthur. After a while the avoidant comes back again and sends all the love to the anxiously attached partner and they start this cycle again. This even though is a toxic situation can be rectified.

The purpose of knowing this information is not to treat your partner like shit and say to yourself that it's because you are an avoidant, or not give them space and time because you have anxious attachment styles. Also these are relative, you might be the anxious one in one realtionship and the avoidant one in another realationship. It's to know your tendnencies so that once it surfaces you can understand where you actions, and your thoughts stem from and your can process and adjust to it the way you want.

Although these are only tendencies, the knowledge about them is not to treat your partner like shit and claim it on being an Avoidant partner. It is for you to be aware of your own tendencies so you can be sure that the issues step from yourself and not the relationship.

Next are our tendencies in dating, this regards more to the actions of us during the mate selection process.

# Understand Relationship

A relatioship is something that is independent from you and your partner. You have to nurture it as a separate entity. This means that you have to put in major effort to maintina it. I believe that the relationship is the first born of a communinon and you have to put in the same amount of effort as raising a cihld into the relationship.

## Build a relationship, not find one

If you have been exposed to tv in any point in your life, you might have grown up thinking about any disney fantasy of romantic love. It always end with the prince and pricess ending up with each other and being happy in the moment with the expectation that they live happily ever after. If the movie was extended to another 2 hours and showed hte prince gaining weight and becoming a couch potato and the princess growing frusturated and resentment due to raising two kids and the inevitable divorce, I think we as humans would have a better idea of love.

Relationships are a lot of work. The chemicals of love designed to keep the species going is so strong that it makes the work literally invisible. Once the happy dance of chemicals and the novely of the relationship wears off, the amount of love just takes a dip. this exposes the amount of work that was required for the relationship to move forward. this makes it hard, and once it gets hard, we come to teh incorrect conclusion that relationships are coming to an end and love is not there, which makes us put even less effort in and love gets reduced which is an unhealthy death spiral. The person who have more residual feelings of love keeps putting in marginally more effort until the lack of love from the other wears them out and the relationship inevitably comes to an end. Then they move on to another relationship where hte initial spark of loves makes the work invisible again. And the spiral continues.

## Choosing a Human Being

We want everything in a partner. Not healthy.

At the end of the day you are choosing another human being and at the core human beings are flawed.

- 80%, 20% rules
  No person is going to have 100% of what you are looking for, they are not made to order. Choose someone who is 80% of what you want. What happens is you see the rest 20% of what you want in another person and you assume the other person will be 100% of what you want. What ends up happening is you'd leave the 80% for the 20% out there and that is going to just wreck you .
- Single, available and emotionally healthy
- List of three musthaves, nice to have and dealbreakers
- Attraction and sexual chemistry and not overcorrecting for it

There is no perfect partner out there, because that would mean there needs to bea perfect human to exist and no one is perfect. Accept the person next to you as a human being who makes mistakes and makes bad decision. At the end of the day, try your best and see if the person next to your is also trying.

Secretary problem.

## Don't put off dating

There is no price at the end of your career. Choose someone who you can grow with. Wouldn't it be awesome if your wife has been with you through thick and thin, rather than a supermodel who you got at the end of the line, who you can't trust to leave you when you might lose all these things.

Taking a haitus from dating when you are working with yourself.

## Be dateable

The first step in getting a date is to be dateable. Although the cliche advice of be yourself is valid, it's not an excuse to put off showering for 2 weeks and call it a day. Although there might be someone out there who is accepting of you, it's best to keep it to yourself. People fall in love with teh edges of your personality, that is what is being true to yourself means. For this you should have a stable lovable core. This means taking care of the basics, hygiene, working out and taking care of yourself physically and emotionally, and working on

## Asking for a date

Whatever you are feeling and whatever you want in a partner there is a lot of people out there who wants the smae things as you do. the purpose of dating is to find the person who is near to you, accessible and with whom you can build a life with. If that is the objective the next step is to maximise the shots you can take. Like Naval says, the guide to find someone is to go on a lot of dates. We have been using dating apps fora long time to know that dating apps do not work and the only thing that works is asking out someone when you see them, it has more chance of working, way less compeition. But that requires a basic level of social confidence that can only be built by getting out there and getting rejected. This is an issue that plauges more men. If you see someone that you are attracted to, approach them. Ask them out like a human. They might not be single, available or want a person like you, it's okay you are not gunning for 100% approach to date ratio, remember you are trying to find a person from teh 10% pool of people who will make a great partner to you. If they don't accept the proposal, you can be happy that they didn't waste any more of your time and you can move on closer to finding the person that you love.

The only way to find someone is to ask a lot fo people out of dates, and get rejected most of the time and find the people who want to give what you two might have another chance. Increase your surface area of finding the person.

## Acting on the date

Be yourself is cliche advice, and is likely going to turn the other person off and end it at first date. It's okay to be rejected on the first date for the real you than getting married and then get rejected when the real you comes out. There is a person who will love you no matter what and every rejection is getting you closer to that person. Let the people who doesn't find the real you with the edges attractive. You have one short life, live authentically. This doesn't mean go to a date without taking shower. Although people fall in love with the edges, you need a stable core to be as attractive as possible. This means taking care of yourself, exercising, developing a great style sense, which greatly improves the people that find you attractive that you can find someone who can love your edges.

# Maintaining a Healthy Relationship

Getting into a relaitonship is easy, it's maintianing one to be a great source of hapiness that the real work resides in. Remember love just makes the work invisible, the strength of the relatinships resides when the work comes to the surface and still the two people do it even when the going gets tough. That is what a relationship is.

- Don't consider everything redflags when they might just be quirks

## Great Sex

Good realtinships have great sex and great sex leads to good relationships. The reason sex is at the top is because sex is primary motivator of the limbic system adn the first thing to go in a relatinship is regular and good sex. Always make it a point to have sex, even when the other person. But sex doesn't just start in teh bedroom, it start with taking care of your body, being presentable, attractive and fuckable. Due to the biological imperative of mating, the drive might go down and not come up for a significant amount of time. That's when the real commitment of sex comes up. Rather than declaring your bedroom dead, try something new, let the action bring back the motivation.

Also make your partner your only column of sexucal release. This means saying goodbye to porn as well. This also dispropritaionly is a man problem. Cut out porn and other outlets and your brain will do the rest.

## Communication and Conflict resolution

Intimate romantic relatinships are the best and the hardest forms of relationships. It requires two different people who came from different familial background, xultures to interact without any walls and share themselves intimately with one another. This will lead to conflict, but the secret is resolution and not letting it get on the backburner and slowly fester to resentment. Conflict resolution is built upon great communication.

Communication is not about yellng at our partner and calling them an ungrateful arroagnt person. Remember you chose this person because you believe that you can build a great life with them, yelling at them is not ging to work. No one can read minds, the first step is letting the other erpson know of your wants and needs verbally. Let them work on it and communicate back to you what they can fulfill and what they can't. Come to a comprosemise on what the things that you can maintian and what you hae to give up. You cannot oncnice someone if they don't wnat to be concinced.

there are going to be fights, there are going to be arguments and there are going to be inevitable name calling. Always try to be calm, never escalate to physical, and never go to bed without a finished argument. A night sleep is going to give you the illusion that the argument is fixed without the underlying issue being fixed.

rupture and repair, peopel from different background, different psyches, hard to maintain.

## Love Languages

People express and expect love in different forms. Some people love girst, some people love physical touch, others words of affirmation and others quality time. It's not to say that they crave only one of theses, but the impacts can be extremenly different. If you crave physical tough and that satisfies you, but your partner loves speinding quality time with you, keep that in mind as well. Don't go your own way once your requirement of love is fulfilled.

## Men are from Mars, and Women are from Venus

Borrowed from a book with the same name, there are fundemental physocological differences between men and women, which manifest in relationships where emotions run high. It's a topic broad enough to not cover here, but do read the book to get a better idea.

## External Stressors

Relatinships and Life runs on teh same timeline. External stressors such as work pressurs, financial situation occupy the same present moment such as the realinosthip. Don't let those issues seep into the realtionshiop, keep external stressors outside the relationship, remember relationships come with it's own stressors that can barely be negated by the love that exists. No relaitnhps is going ot survice external stressors as well.

## Maintaining great long term compatiblity

Almost any two people can be in a relationship for a short amount of time with zero consious efrot, but building out a long term commitment requires a lon of effort. Maintaining a relaitonship also takes work. Remeber no amount of hapiness or fulfillment ever came easy, because if they did, they would we wounn'dt have an epidemic of drug.

The key to maintainfing a great long term realtionshisp is to be consious ofhte fact that it's going to take a tremendous amount of effort, but the payoff is well worth it. You are going to have to make compromises, tolerate family members of your partner that you hate, love and have sex when you don't feel 100% lovable and sexy and sitting through a pottery class with your partner when you'd rather spend your sunday at home. But these are the amount of work that is needed to make something work that is guarnateed to give you a steady source of happiness in your life.

Read the book Men are from Mars and women aare from Venus.

## Marriage and Kids

This is a deeply personal decision and with serious cconsqueences. Unlike relatioships marrige is a legal contract that requiers serious effort to get out of. So to make that level of commitment is a deeply personal and life altering decision. Carefully consider those and don't rush, ask yourself if when the going goes tough, you want to wake up next to the person and still love thier wrinkly skin and snort after 10000 nights together. Because if you are willing to put in the work, that's wehn you commit.

I love kids, so I'm all for little versions of me, running around and causing all sorts of havoc on the world. But if you want kids, make sure that you want them enough to work your ass off and give a significant part of your life, efforts and fruits of your labour to someone who might not love you back once they grow up.

### Alternative realtionships paths

Even though the traditional forms of long term monogamous relationship has only been around as an institution for the better part of 500 years, it's still the best way forward.

Read Neil Strauss book on love and relationships.

# Breaking Up

All relatinshsp do not end in one partners death. It has to end due to other reasons, which brings us to the painful part of any relatioship, when it ends.

## Understanding toxicity

If it's a toxic relationship, get out. I believe that almost all people are good and the acts of amlice cna be attrrubted to stupidity, and bad decisions. But some people are broken and even though I have empathy for the trauma that causes these pattersn of behaviour, it's still something that they need to work on and clear. If you have to deal with abuse, emotional or physical, gaslight or plain threats of physical harm, get out. Even if however complex the situation is, however hard it's going to be it's going to be better if you leave. We live in a society where is a semblance of support of people.

### Infidielity

Don't do it. However the story ends, it's always ugly and scarring for life.

## Understanding incompatibility

You can be incompatible with another person if your core values are different which will inevitably lead you along two different parts and any sort of compromise will only lead to resentment. That is when you are incompatibile. But some people think they are incompatible when the love dies down between.

## Figure out if breakup is the right decision

Think long and hard and preferably at time apart and non-emotinally about the breakup. Breaking up is like breaking a ceramic cup, you can put it back togther and sometimes like the japanese art of gold cups it might come out more beautiful than before, but it leads to a lot of hurt and pain that should be avoided if it can be.

Breakup if you believe with conviction that it is the right and kind thing to do to let the other person go so you two can be happy, nad breakup when being single is better than your current situation.

## Handling a breakup properly

The best way to handle a breakup or if you have been broken up is to aim for a clean breakup. Cut all contact, wish them the best, forgive them and yourself for any mistakes that you have done and let them go. Break it off clean, that means no checking up on them, no breakup sex and no staying friends and staying in loose contact to give it one more chance. It's the most responsible, mature, kind thing to do for both of you. Let them move on and you in thier life is an impediment to that.

If you have been broken up with, no-conact is the best thing you can do too. Never beg or plead if you want to reconcile and even though it's tremendously hard, you have to channel every ounce of willpower to never initite contact. If they wanted the breakup, no amount of begging or pleading is going to ever change their mind and is only going to push them away more. Wish them the best, ask for space and then stop contacting them.

### Rebound relationship

The easiest way to get over the pain of a breakup is to get under someone else. Even though the idea seem like it might work, and is widely suggested it's an unhealthy and unfair thing to do. Unhealthy in the fact ath you are buring your grief soa future you waill have to deal with a shit ton of more pain and unfair because on the other side is another human being who is being used a temporary jumpoing board. It also complicates reconcilation in the future as well. Be mature and sit with the grief until you can process it.

### Process Grief

An end of a relationships is going to trigger deep seated insecurities and unprocessed traumas from your life, combine that with the loss of an intimate support in this age of lonliness, it's going to hit you and it's going to hit you hard. Even thought the manifestation of the pain and grief is different for the person who chose to breakup and the person broken up with, it's still gonig to hurt and you are going to experience pain on a level that you haven't expereinced yet. Just keep in mind that however hard it's gonig to be, you will have to hunker down and process it.

Less unprocessed baggage is why relationshisp of young people work out.

## Reconcilation

Relationships end for a reason and the pain sometimes cna bring back the relatinships toghether only to be later broken up agian. Reconcilation is a tricky concept as it affects the dumper(the person who ended the relatinoshiop) and the dumpee(the person on the other side).

Think deep and hard about why you want to get together, think what has changed.

If you broke up and wants to reconcile. You have more resposnbilbity of introspection and change. YOu have to look inward and ask yourself what has changed, what problems caused the relationships to end and what work has been done by you to address those changes. Remember if you break up and make the decision to reconcile, and they accept and you rekindle and you break it off again, you are an asshole, so make sure your decision to reconcile is driven by a geniunine desire and not because you are missing a person and not the person you broke up with.

If you are broken up with, you have to decide why you want to get back gotgher. Why do you think the other person broke up with you, what changed and why do you think you should get back together with them.

Reconcilating and making it work is one of the most beautiful things in a realtinoship, it exposes he effort and opens the eyes of the ones to how much they miss one another. But make sure you get back toghet erf rot thie right reasons.

# Love yourself and Trust the Universe

What I understood is when interacting with another person in such an vuleralbe position as an initimate relstionship with no is really and any sore of information about love and relationships is not going to make it magically make me have a better relaitonship. You can just try and let the universe work it out.
