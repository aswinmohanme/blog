UPI or United Payments Interface is the ubiquitous payment method in India. Learn how it works under the hood.

## The User Experience of UPI
If you haven't used UPI and have only heard about it, this is how the UPI works.

* The Payer (person who wants to pay) opens up their UPI app and enters the UPI Id or scans the QR code of the Payee (person who receives the payment)
* The Payer then enters the amount and selects the bank account that they want to send the money from
* The UPI app then asks for the UPI pin and in around three seconds the money is sent.


## How a UPI transaction takes place.
Rather than go through the entire terms of the ecosystem, let's start with two people who wants to make a UPI transaction and build it from first principles. 

In the true spirit of Indian Government ads, let's start with Ramu and Damu. Ramu wants to send Damu Rs.100. Let's see how the transaction takes place from the first step to the last step and we'll introduce the different entities along the way. We'll introduce different UPI concepts and how it works along the transaction.


## The world of Ramu and Damu
Before we start with the transaction, let's establish the world where Ramu and Damu lives in. Ramu and Damu are living in India. Ramu has an account with SBI and Damu has an account with Yes Bank. Ramu and Damu both has an account balance of Rs.1000.


## Ramu sets up UPI
Damu had lend Rs.100 Ramu for his son's birthday and Ramu decided to pay Damu via UPI. Ramu doesn't have UPI setup yet. So he goes on the Play Store to download a UPI app to send the payment.

### UPI Apps
UPI Apps are the consumer facing side of the UPI network. Users interact with the network through these Apps. Only regulated Banks are allowed to interface with the UPI network. This means only banking apps and third party apps with backing of banks can connect to the UPI network. Each app may be backed by multiple banks and have unique handles per backing. CRED is backed by Axis bank and Google Pay is backed by multiple banks. BHIM is the official app released with UPI. You can find a list of approved apps and their connected banks here, https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/upi/3rd-party-apps. They are called **Third Party Application Providers, TPAPs**.

#### Payment Service Provider - PSP
The banks which provide these services are called Payment Service Providers. PSP onboards the users, authenticates the user during registration, ensures the TPAPs are compliant and secure, and give grievance redressal mechanism for resolving complaints. PSP which onboarded Ramu is called the **Payer PSP**, and PSP which onboarded Damu is called the **Payee PSP**.

Damu decides to go with Google Pay and downloads the app. He sets up the App and starts the Registration process.

### Registration process
To start using UPI, the user must have a bank account and a debit card linked to that bank account. The mobile number used for registration should also be linked to the Bank account. During registration the app sends an SMS to the servers with a one-time code generated by the App. This identifies the linked bank account and the user can then set it up from there. UPI transactions require two-factor authentication, hence a UPI Pin needs to be setup as well.

Now Ramu has setup his UPI account and is now ready to send his payment to Damu.


## Finding Damu
Ramu now needs to find Damu on the UPI network so the money reaches him safely. Unlike the by-gone days, we do not need the account number and the IFSC code to send the payment, we need the unique VPA that is generated during UPI signup to send and recieve money.

The VPA is valid and now Ramu wants to send Rs.100 to Damu's account.

### VPA - Virtual Payment Address
Every person on the UPI network will have a unique address identifying them. The VPA is a combination of a user identifier and an entity identifier that identifies the issuing bank separated by a `@` symbol, like `ramu@sbi` and `damu@yes`. The VPA uniquely identifies the UPI account. A single bank account can have multiple VPA's associated with them. A VPA can have multiple banks accounts associated with them, but one is required to be primary.
