Everything in your life ultimately comes down to how much you are lucky. You miss your train, go to the coffee shop for a drink distressed but meet your future wife there. You went to raise capital for your next startup venture and the VC has attended one your conference talks from before and she really loved how entusiastic and passionate you are about the technical side of your product. You apply for your dream job and even though you are underqualified, the recruiter was the sister of your college-roomate and unknown to you, put in a personal word for you. There is nothing you could have done to force these circumstances to happen, and the only course of action is to accept the seredependity and be greateful for the good things that happen in your life.

But if luck is 100% the game, why should we extend any effort in our lives. We could very well lock ourselves inside a closed room and let luck do it's thing and bring to us a good spouse, a great job and well lived life. Even though a life like that is possible and has a minute chance of working out in your favour, it's better to create and increase your own luck. We can do that by reducing the amount of influence luck plays and increasing the surface area of luck.

## Reduce the influence of luck
The best way to improve your luck is to be independent of it. Rather than leaving 100% of the result to luck, we can reduce the amount of effect unpredictable luck plays in our lives by increasing our actions we take towards our goals. Let's say we want to raise investment for our next startup, rather than hoping that luck brings in 

a magical VC that understand you, you should do the hell out of the things you can control. You should work on your startup, improve your traction, improve your metrics and do the things so the influence luck plays is reduced.

## Improving the surface area of luck
Even if you do the entire thing, the amount of luck plays is still going to be significant. So what you have to do is increase the surface area of luck, so you get more luck of being lucky.
