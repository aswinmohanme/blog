I have been using Github Copilot from the time it came out to a couple weeks ago. 

When I code with an LLM, I feel like the code is machine produced, there are edges poking out, you can notice that out there, but when I write code by myself, it feels like I bought made a pottery can out there.

It's like pottery, AI is a machine that can produce a pot then and there. The first pot I made sucked, there was a lot of issues that my instructor had to get it over with.

I have been relying on Github Copilot for a while now. After the suggestion from a colleague, I setup [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider) and went full LLM on my codebase. I was able to reap the benefits of the transistion fast.

After trying out [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider) for a couple times. 

We are seeing an explosion in the quantity of software products coming out from the woods. AI tools like Cursor combined with ubiquitous UI frameworks like Shadcn have enabled a generation of builders to ship out decent looking and functional products out in a matter of hours. Every subsequent AI model is better than the past, and not being on the latest one feels like missing out.

I have been using [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) for well over six months now. Entire function definitions and module definitions are only a tab-completion away. If I get stuck, the solution is to paste the error message to any one of the number of AI providers and try out the solution, repeating the process until the error goes away. No more digging through StackOverflow, Github issues or decade old forum posts to find the solution. Everything is a couple tokens away. The volume of code I write is huge, but there is something amiss, and it's beauty.

## Gluing together machined parts
Consider the fact that I want to make a cup. Coding with AI is similar to taking a lego approach, where you get a couple blocks of machined parts and your job is to glue them together to make a cup. The edges are rough, there is a shape amiss, but you sand it down, glue it up and you have a cup. The number of cups you make with zero experience in pottery is staggering. But there are still pieces sticking together, even when you have put a lot of effort into it, a closer look and you can see it it's stuck together. The cups you make are limited by the machines that make the cup parts. The machines are outside your control and you wish they become better, and they might.

Contrast this to deciding to make a cup from clay. You get wet, dirty and muddy. You require an experienced mentor. You struggle, spend a inordinate amount of time making the cup. Everything is going wrong, and you struggle and you hate every second of it until you make a cup. And, it's worse than the machined cup your friend made with 1/10th the effort. You consider going through the machined route, and seriously consider pivoting. What's the point ?

The magic happens when you keep making cups. You get more wet, more muddier, and more dirty. You learn better techniques from better masters. You read about pottery, you watch videos about pottery, you spend hours looking for techniques to better fire the cups. You keep making cups after cups each one marginally better than the other, still far away from the machined cups the cool kids are making. There are days when you question the why, but you keep on going because making cups is becoming fun for you. You keep making more cups, you discover ways to speed up the process, a better firing way. Little tidbits like adding salt, using a different better clay. You keep doing for a long time and one day you notice something different. Your cups are getting better.

They are sturdier, they are more perfect than the ones that came before, they are stronger, more pretty to look at. But they are behind the machined cups, the new generations of machine came out which are making even better cup parts.

You still keep going, because you are a cup maker now and making cups is your job. You start to make even more complex cups, cups with two handles, cups with no holes, cups that need to be inverted to be drank from. You run into all sorts of issues. Unlike the initial issues, these issues are hard to fix, some issues you are the first to experience. You read about the clay, try out variations of a solution that worked for someother issue. You are stuck for days, you try out different methods and find a solution. You keep this up for a long time until one day, the cup is better.

Your cup is beautiful, it's better in every metric, it's functional, it's easy to drink from. The machines have graduated one more generation but are inferior to your cups. Your cups have secret ingredients even the machine have no knowldege about. Your cups have beauty that is nowhere to be found in the machined part cups. People start to hear about the cups and you make a fan following. People are willing to pay extra for the beautiful cups. But the real change is not in the cups, it's the cupmaker. You make the cup, the cup makes you.

Every setback and every solution made you a better cup maker, made you a better craftman. Making these cups changed you, made you better with every step. You were not making cup, you were chaning yourself into a master cupmaker. The effort was obvilious to you because deep down you loved making these cups. You keep making cups, ones even teh machines aren't able to come up with yet. And one day you get approached by the machine makers to improve their machines, so a generation of cup gluers can benefit from your skill. You get to keep making cups, make a ton of money doing the same, all because you paid the price.


## True craftmanship has a price
AI helps you cross the chasm of skill issue but abandones you at the edges.

Struggling with a problem might produce a worse looking cup, but it makes you a better craftman with the ability to inch one step closer to true beauty.

True beauty is rare in this world, and to expose the beauty from the world, you have to pay the price to be a craftman.

Master craftmanship has a price, it's the years of struggling that not only produces a better cup, but a better craftman that is able to produce a better product. If you love your craft, pay that price, you'll be a better craftman than the machines can ever dream of.
