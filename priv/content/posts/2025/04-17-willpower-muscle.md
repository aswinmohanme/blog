Willpower is characteristically similar to a muscle. It gets weaker with use. That is why you feel depleted at the end after a honest day of hard work, and why most productivity advice recommend that you start with your hardest task in the morning when your willpower is at it's highest. 

It's also the reason why you can't stick with most tasks after you have committed to them. Your willpower muscle is weak, most probably from underuse.

The best thing about willpower being a muscle is that you can train it. You can progressively overload your willpower enough that its depleted at the end of the day. And the next day it will be a little bit more stronger and you'll have more willpower to work with. Do this continously and your willpower will be capable of doing the hard things that you want to do.
