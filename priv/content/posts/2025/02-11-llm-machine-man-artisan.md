When I code with an LLM, I feel like the code is machine produced, there are edges poking out, you can notice that out there, but when I write code by myself, it feels like I bought made a pottery can out there.

It's like pottery, AI is a machine that can produce a pot then and there. The first pot I made sucked, there was a lot of issues that my instructor had to get it over with.

I have been relying on Github Copilot for a while now. After the suggestion from a colleague, I setup [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider) and went full LLM on my codebase. I was able to reap the benefits of the transistion fast.

After trying out [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider) for a couple times.
