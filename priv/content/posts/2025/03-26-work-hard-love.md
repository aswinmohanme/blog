The secret to a happy working life, or atleast what has given me the most amount of satisfaction is working hard on things I love to work on. Also pursuing the thing I love to do and working hard on it has done more for my career than taking cold calculated steps to work on things I didn't find interesting. The prerequisite for this principle is to find what you love working on.

## Find the thing you love to work on

Doing the thing you love to do makes everything about work a lot better. You do it for longer, you do it better and you feel satisfied at the end of it. The reward is the ability to do more of the work. It can the side-project you can't stop working on after work, the project car in your garage that costs more than a new one, the new mobile app your team is building because you rallied for it at work. 

The best to find work that you love to do is to 
1. Do a lot of things
2. Continue doing the things that you love to do
3. Continue until you find something you can't stop working on

You have to trust your judgement on this, because it's the only valid indicator about love.

## Work hard on the thing you love
Once you have found the thing you love to work on, the next step is to work hard at it. This is much easier as you're working on the things you love to work on, so you're intrinsic motiviation will be doing half the work for you. Try to work as hard as you can, for as long as you can, so you can work more on the thing you love.

Love breeds [obsession](/obessive) and that brings out the best work in you out into the world. If you do all this, even if it doesn't work out on any other metric, you'd have spend a couple hours doing the thing you love. What is a good life but a collection of great moments you love.
