I have hated maths for the longest time, from school all through
college. I loved it until \(x\) and \(y\) showed up. I never really
understood how abstract mathematics would help me in real life, hence
never gave any effort to the subject.
</p>
<p>
I rediscovered math while watching

and the detailed visual explanations helped me understand mathematics in
a far deeper level that I ever could in school. Going down that path has
helped me realise and love what mathematics really is, a simulation of
reality.
</p>
<h2>Math is the Physical World on Paper</h2>
<p>
    Although I never loved math, I was intensely curious about it. Math
    had consistent properties and patterns that always intrigued me, how
    equations can accurately predict physical outcomes and how certain
    quantities relate beautifully to each other.
</p>
<p>
    Consider the famous equation \( E=mc^2 \). When we were deriving this
    formula in school, We would start out with the formula for one
    dimensional motion, and after derivations and integration we would
    arrive at the formula for making Nuclear Bombs. Even though this was
    fascinating, I never really gave it any thought in school.
</p>
<p>
    Everytime I came across equations and numbers
    <a href="https://twitter.com/fermatslibrary">Fermats Library</a> that
    are remotely interesting, the thought of how one mathematical symbol
    flows effortsly to another comes to mind.
</p>
<p>
    During my zoning out in the middle of the day ritual, I was thinking
    about numbers and wanted to know exactly why \(2+2 = 4\), and what is
    the deeper meaning of mathematics. I came to the conclusion that
    \(2+2=4\) is so because \(4=2+2\).
</p>
<p>
    Consider an apple. Now consider another apple. How many apples do we
    have now? We have \(2\) apples. So what is \(2\) then? \(2\)
    symbolically represents the amount of apples we have when we take one
    apple and another apple. Let's say we have another \(2\) apples, so
    the total number of apples we have is \(4\). So in that respect if we
    take one apple, then another, then another, and finally another, \(4\)
    denotes the thing that we have now.
</p>
<p>
    Math is then an abstraction on top of the physical world. It's a way
    for us to work with symbols that can be easily manipulated on paper as
    our primary medium. Math is then a language for representing the
    physical world. It's nothing more. But that is the sole reason why it
    reflects the physical world so beautifully. It's a language as close
    to the metal as possible. It is the shallowest usable abstraction that
    we have.
</p>
<p>
    When we are working with maths, we are working in a reduced set of the
    world with clearly defined rules. We are manipulating a clearly
    defined model of the physical world.
</p>
<p>Consider the formula.</p>
\[ \begin{aligned} F &= ma \\ a &= \frac{v - u}{t} \\ F &=
m(\frac{v-u}{t}) \end{aligned} \]
<p>
    What this formula is saying is that Force \(F\) is what we get when we
    throw a mass \(m\) with an accelration \(a\). Whatever that is
    required to throw a mass with \(m\) with accelration \(a\) is denoted
    by \(F\). Accelaration \(a\) is whatever the change in final velocity
    \(v\) and initial velocity \(u\) over a period of time \(t\). So force
    \(F\) becomes the effort requried to stop a moving body in a given
    time \(t\). That is the conceptual model of force. Hence \(F\) denotes
    that quantity, which is also denoted as <code>Force</code> in the
    English language. We can then mathematically calculate that quantity
    on paper, instead of physically moving that object and measuing it.
</p>
<p>
    This is the reason why we have formulas that makes sense and meshes so
    well with the real world. The real world does not obey the rules of
    mathematics, mathematics is the real world in abstraction.

<h2>Math is beautiful</h2>
<p>
    Math hence is beautiful. Math is what asembly is to the CPU. Not
    binary but close enough to be tremendously useful. Math makes sense,
    it's the only true language. It reduces complex physical interactions
    into easily manipulatable symbols without the chaos of the physical
    world.
</p>
<p>
    We need to teach students that math is nothing more than an
    abstraction, but an abstraction that mirrors the real world in it's
    entirety. Having mastering over it, not only helps you understand it,
    but gives you a sandbox to test your theory that you can use it to
    bend reality. Math is now very, very interesting, go I wish I knew
    this earilier.
