The world is a competitive place where your oppurtunities are determined to a large extent by how [lucky you are](/on-luck). The world is also run by people. So a surefire way to improve your luck is for them to remember you. And for them to remember and recommend you, you need to delight them.

If you do what people want, and what you do is in-line with their expectations, they become satisfied. Satisfaction is a near neutral expression barely touching happiness. The next time we want to recommend someone for ourselves or to someone else, you'll be competing with everyone who has made us satisfied, which would be a lot since bare satisfaction is the highest goal most aim for.

Delight is when you exceed their expectations by a positive multiple. Delight is what makes people happy, and we rarely forget what makes us happy. Delight is when you show up to a date with lillies which she casually mentioned in a text message two weeks ago, when your business responds to a customer query with competant agents and resolves it under 10 mins, when a human picks up the phone instead of an IVR auto prompt, when you refactor the codebase to make your app faster, when you app loads with a cut animal avatar that closes their eyes when an error occurs. These things delights us, these things make us happy when we least expect them to be, and these actions give a glimpse of beauty, a glimpse of someone who cares in a world that so craves it, yet recieves so little of it.

Delight makes people remember you, it makes it a no-brainer for people to work with you, to come with you on a second date, to rave about your business and your app to their friends and families. People love to go back to and recommend things that made them happy. If you delight at every interaction, each recommendation compounds, slightly improving your chances at luck.

Delight is hard. If it was the default path, everyone would be doing it and it would be the new normal. Delight takes effort. It takes effort to [find edges](/edges) where you can delight, it takes effort to put in the extra effort to delight, and it takes effort to do it for every interaction. But the results combined with it's compounding nature is so profound to not do it.

If delighting at every point is hard, strive to delight at the points of interaction. If it's hard to do for every point of interaction, strive to delight atleast a single time.

Let every interaction be an exercise in delight, let every interaction be a positive marker that makes you a no-brainer to work with, love and recommend. Delight, delight, delight!
