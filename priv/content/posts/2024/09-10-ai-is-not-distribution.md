A lot of people are comparing the current AI wave to the previous Internet and Mobile waves and predicting that these will allow new startups an edge over the existing companies and produce the next wave of unicorns. We are seeing a lot of new companies being started up which are clones of existing companies + AI.

Even though there is going 

# No new platform, no new users
Unlike Web and Mobile which brought with them new platforms and a gradual uptick of users, AI is not bringing any more new platforms or any news users. The users part is constant. This means that the companies that already control the distribution has an inherent advantage. 

# No need to change core business model
Consider a brick and mortar store trying to shift to the web when it launched. It needed to figure out a lot of things, and due to the number of users not being on web, they didn't mind the platform. But an online bookstore got online, grew with the number of users, and by the time the brick and mortar stores came to this, they were playing catchup.

# AI is a commodity 
Unlike the Mobile wave, which required mobile developers who were in short supply, there were no help, no courses, most developers had to figure things out by themselves. Which gave the companies that had the best developers an advantage. Currently having AI integrated into your App is a day's work, and there is no specialised skillset requiring the integration. You just need to know how to call an AI and you are AI ready.

# Competition against distribution is hard
If you are building an existing company + AI, you have to first match what the company does and then add AI. Since adding AI require no fundemental changes to their businesses, and hence no risk but with a lot of advantages, and AI can be integrated with their already existing workfroce, you'll be overtaken by the time you get to market.

# Back to basics
The only way to ride this wave is to bulid out things that are basically good. Build out a platform that is better than the exisitng ones without AI, so you can be better with AI. We have to start with products that are from the ground up enabled by AI.
