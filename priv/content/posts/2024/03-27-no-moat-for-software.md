Software alone is not a great moat, if you're selling software, you'll be overtaken by open source tools that will do what you are doing for far cheaper, you should provide a service as well, that preferably includes humans in the loop, hard to replicate and have economies of scale. Stripe is not just an app you install, Deel is the same. But providing the service isn't the only thing as well, you need to package it inside a nice software package as well.
