    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Hey, I'm Aswin Mohan. I'm a Software Developer who works across
      frontend, backend, mobile and design. I am currently based out of
      Kerala, India. I love to design, code and make bold, beautiful, useful
      things. I love film photography, old typewriters and completely
      mechanical things.
    </p>
    <p>
      I primarly work with Elixir, Phoenix LiveView, React, NextJS, React
      Native and TailwindCSS. I do occasional Rails, Flutter and sometimes
      UI/UX design to make something look less ugly.

    <p>
      This blog is my corner on the Internet. I love to write, to share my
      thoughts with the world, to have great conversations with people and
      enjoy life. I'm forever grateful for the Internet for providing a near free platform for that. This blog doesn't have any other goals
      than being a public record of my thoughts, so expect it to be a
      small garden with flowers, moss and weeds all growing together. You can find my resume

        Currently working on a stealth B2B focused startup as a solo-founder. The B2B cross-border payments space even though is $100T Industry, is still in it's earliest stages of user-experience, far overtaken by consumer payments.
        We are at a point where we can improve the end-to-end B2B payments experience.
