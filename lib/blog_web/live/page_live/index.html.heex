    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Hey, I'm Aswin Mohan. I'm a Software Developer who works across
      frontend, backend, mobile and design. I am currently based out of
      Kerala, India. I love to design, code and make bold, beautiful, useful
      things. I love film photography, old typewriters and completely
      mechanical things.
    </p>
    <p>
      I primarly work with Elixir, Phoenix LiveView, React, NextJS, React
      Native and TailwindCSS. I do occasional Rails, Flutter and sometimes
      UI/UX design to make something look less ugly.

    <p>
      This blog is my corner on the Internet. I love to write, to share my
      thoughts with the world, to have great conversations with people and
      enjoy life. I'm forever grateful for the Internet for providing a near free platform for that. This blog doesn't have any other goals
      than being a public record of my thoughts, so expect it to be a
      small garden with flowers, moss and weeds all growing together. You can find my resume
      <a target="_blank" href="./resume.pdf">here</a>

        Currently working as an Elixir Phoenix Consultant with pre MVP and Early Stage Startups. Primarily focused on Web and Mobile apps with the backend in Phoenix, web frontend in LiveView and mobile in React Native and styling with TailwindCSS.

      <p>
        Currently working on a stealth B2B focused startup as a solo-founder. The B2B cross-border payments space even though is $100T Industry, is still in it's earliest stages of user-experience, far overtaken by consumer payments.
        We are at a point where we can improve the end-to-end B2B payments experience.

        Working on Nello. It's a payment app that consolidates different
        payment methods so you can send money locally and globally and we'll
        route your money through the cheapest, fastest payment method. In
        it's most earliest stages and needs a lot of work.

          Building the Map Frontend for Kerala Rescue - FOSSMeet '19
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p class="mt-2">
        During the floods of Kerala in 2018, I built a map based frontend
        for Kerala Rescue. It was deployed along side the official disaster
        management platform. This talk covers the story behind it.

          Shuji Nakamura, Blue LED, 10+ years
        </a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the late ‚Äô80s, blue LEDs were a dead end. Gallium nitride was impossible. Nichia sent Shuji Nakamura to study MOCVD; he came back, ripped apart their machine, and rebuilt it. Management told him to stop. He ignored them. Years of tweaking, annealing, and sheer stubbornness later, in 1992, he cracked it‚Äî1,500 ¬µW of blue light. It changed the world. Nichia barely acknowledged him. He left, sued, won. Now he‚Äôs working on nuclear fusion.

          Britta Sp√§th and Marc Cabanes, McKay conjecture, 20 years
        </a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        In 2003, a German graduate student named Britta Sp√§th encountered the McKay conjecture, one of the biggest open problems in the mathematical realm known as group theory. At first her goals were relatively modest: She hoped to prove a theorem or two that would make incremental progress on the problem, as many other mathematicians had done before her. But over the years, she was drawn back to it, again and again. Whenever she tried to focus on something else, she said, ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt connect.‚Äù

          Ken Thompson, Text Editor, Assembler and Kernel for Unix, 3 weeks
        </a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        In 1969, Ken Thompson, a researcher at Bell Labs, was experimenting with operating system designs. Bell Labs had a PDP-7 computer with an interesting peripheral device: a very fast (for the time) disk drive. Ken experimented by writing a custom interface to maximize throughput for the drive.

        At some point, Ken realized he had put so much work into the interface that it was almost an operating system itself.
        <br />
        Thompson figured he needed three more weeks to make it into a prototype operating system: one week each to write an editor, an assembler, and a kernel.

        That prototype was the start of the Unix system.
